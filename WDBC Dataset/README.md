# Kaggle Dataset
<p>
https://www.kaggle.com/imrankhaliq/wdbc-dataset/notebook<br>
It is a dataset of Analysis of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Data.<br>
I came up with it from my friends coursework in his university and I tried to do it by myself.
Basically, it is a good practice of using sklearn package, get familiar with PCA, decision tree and SVM.

The requirement is using Matlab but I use python for future use.
